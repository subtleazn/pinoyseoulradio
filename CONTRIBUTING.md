# Contributing to Pinoy Seoul Radio

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Pinoy Seoul Radio! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## Where do I start?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please make sure it hasn't already been reported by searching for it in the [Issues](https://github.com/subtleazn/pinoyseoulradio/issues) section. If you can't find an open issue addressing the problem, please [open a new one](https://github.com/subtleazn/pinoyseoulradio/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue with the "enhancement" label. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it would be useful, and if possible, a mockup or wireframe.

### Pull Requests

We love pull requests! If you're planning to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment** by following the instructions in `docs/SETUP.md`.
